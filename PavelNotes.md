## Functional programming

### Lambda calculus

#### History

- Alonzo Church (1903 - 1995)
  - Inventor of lambda calculus
  - Q: What is a notion of a function from computational perspective?
  - A: Lambda calculus
  - PhD supervisor of Alan Turing
    - State-based Turing machines
    - vs. Lambda calculus
  - Church-Turing hypothesis
    - States that these two are equivalent

#### Function

- A black-box
  - Not allowed to look inside
  - Pure
    - No internal state
    - No hidden information
    - Oposite of Turing machines
- What can you do with a function?
  - Calculate it for some inputs

#### Why?

- Any program can be written in lambda calculus
  - Hence Church-Turing hypothesis
  - Basis for functional programming languages
    - Like Haskell
  - Now present in most programming languages
    - Like Python, C#, Java

## Logic programming

### Prolog
